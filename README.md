As a leftist and socialist, I see in this work a monument to the exploited class. First of all, this is the working class, due to the majority of the tools of labor. But also, the project itself has a pyramid structure. This is an allusion to the very structure of society, where only a small part of humanity has most of the goods. There are also no labor tools on the top of the pyramid. But why is there only a woman's head on top? It seems to me that these are sacrifices of a woman in the role of a mother. As women began to enter the labor market on an equal basis with men, the role of the mother receded into the background. And the time to care for the child has become significantly less. This is not only child care, but also household work that is not paid. In modern Japan, for example, the birth rate is at a record low in its history. Women make up 40.0% of all employed men and women, this is one of the highest figures in comparison with other countries. And every year the population in developed countries decreases, if you do not take into account immigrants. This is a contradiction of capitalism, which is ready to sacrifice the future of humanity for the sake of profit. On the other hand, poor countries have much higher birth rates. But due to the very low standard of living in these countries, there is a high mortality rate in children.
This project can also be considered from the perspective of social justice. This work is about the hard work of workers, migrants and women whose rights are violated every day all over the world.
Migrant oppression is a serious problem that has various aspects and manifestations.

Economic oppression: Many migrants come in search of work and often end up in low-paying and unstable jobs. They may be forced to take unskilled jobs, receive low wages and lack social security. This creates inequality in access to economic opportunities.

Discrimination: Migrants may face discrimination based on their nationality or ethnicity. They may be denied equal rights and opportunities in the labor market and may face hostility from employers or society.

Illegal migration: Many migrants are forced to resort to illegal migration due to the lack of legal immigration routes. This makes them especially vulnerable to surveillance authorities and puts them at risk of arrest and deportation.

Lack of social protection: Migrants, especially illegal migrants, often lack access to social services, including health care and education. This leaves them without protection in the event of illness or other disasters.

Family Separation: Many migrants are forced to leave their families and loved ones behind due to the inability to obtain legal status in the new country. This destroys family ties and creates emotional oppression.

There are many examples that can be given, but the most glaring example of contrasts is Dubai. Dubai has become the most popular tourism destination in a very short time. Glass skyscrapers, expensive cars, billionaires from different countries, an oasis in the desert, etc. But behind all this screen of luxury is the labor of millions of migrants. And practically they are slaves in the 21st century. Their documents are taken away when leaving the country and they have to work for several years just to leave the country. On the one hand, 10 percent are rich Arabs and tourists, on the other, 90 percent are migrants who do not even have basic human rights, not to mention a decent standard of living.
