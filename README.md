As a leftist and socialist, I see in this work a monument to the exploited class. First of all, this is the working class, due to the majority of the tools of labor. But also, the project itself has a pyramid structure. This is an allusion to the very structure of society, where only a small part of humanity has most of the goods. There are also no labor tools on the top of the pyramid. But why is there only a woman's head on top? It seems to me that these are sacrifices of a woman in the role of a mother. As women began to enter the labor market on an equal basis with men, the role of the mother receded into the background. And the time to care for the child has become significantly less. This is not only child care, but also household work that is not paid. In modern Japan, for example, the birth rate is at a record low in its history. Women make up 40.0% of all employed men and women, this is one of the highest figures in comparison with other countries. And every year the population in developed countries decreases, if you do not take into account immigrants. This is a contradiction of capitalism, which is ready to sacrifice the future of humanity for the sake of profit. On the other hand, poor countries have much higher birth rates. But due to the very low standard of living in these countries, there is a high mortality rate in children.
